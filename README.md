# HTML-and-CSS

Training HTML, CSS and JavaScript with little projects mainly based on Traversy Media and other tutorials.

Includes also course materials and practice projects from Udemy-course "Modern HTML & CSS From The Beginning (including Sass)" by Brad Traversy which I studied and finished during March 2020.
